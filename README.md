# Task 1 Software configuration 

### **Subtask 1** Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hey! My name is Ann. A long time ago in a galaxy far-far away I worked as an English teacher. But then my life's changed and I moved to Wroclaw in Poland. 

I decided to participate in the challenge portfolio, because I'm convinced it's time for something new - new knowledge, new life and new me. My *goal* is completing the challenge and getting a lot of new information. Maybe I could try to develop myself in a new profession.

### Good luck, Ann.
